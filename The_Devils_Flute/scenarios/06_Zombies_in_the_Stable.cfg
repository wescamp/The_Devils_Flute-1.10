Our luck was that he wasn't an experienced necromancer, so he couldn't really keep order among his soldiers. The aimlessly wandering skeletons soon drew the attention of his pursuers, and he was taken down by the Wesnothian Special Forces in an ambush the public never got informed of."

Time passed, and the original creators died one after one - along with the king. The new government didn't share the old ruler's concerns, and showed great interest in this weapon. Nobody lived who knew how the flute worked, though. So it was assigned to me to examine the device and find out its working mechanisms."

But I had to learn that our men overlooked a crucial thing on that day - Ludwig somehow managed to blow the flute with his last breath, and he was reborn as Mal Amadeus. By the time I got to know that he's still alive and seeks for the flute it was too late - he located me, and... you know the story from here."
