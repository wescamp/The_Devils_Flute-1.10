However, when you attack a zombie, you will push it away by one hex. A zombie which gets hit becomes fuzzy and can't move in the next turn (but still can attack!). You can also toss whole queues of zombies like dominos. Any enemy pushed into one of the stables (the two villages near the bottom of the map) will be instantly removed from the game.

<b>Warning:</b> don't push zombies out of the map. You won't be able to win the scenario if you do so. This is a technical issue which will be fixed in the future."

The king could have raised taxes quite high with this tool in his hand."

			message=_ "The problems appeared when a talented young mage, Ludwig joined the development. It turned out that the original designers were uneducated in music, and they made a huge mistake. The flute worked as intended when the melody was in major, but was completely untested for minor tonalities. Unfortunately, Ludwig was an excellent flute player, and he found the secret flaw - minor tonality sounded so nerve-rackingly terrifying on this instrument that even the dead resonated to it."
		[/message]
		[message]
			speaker=Dunduggwyn
			message=_ "You might guess the rest... corrupted by the power it gave to him, Ludwig escaped with the flute and started to build up an undead army. Our luck was that he wasn't an experienced necromancer, so he couldn't really keep order among his soldiers. The aimlessly wandering skeletons soon drew the attention of his pursuers, and he was taken down by the Wesnothian Special Forces in an ambush the public never got informed of."

Time passed, and the original creators died one after one - along with the king. The new government didn't share the old ruler's concerns, and showed great interest in this weapon. Nobody lived who knew how the flute worked, though. So it was assigned to me to examine the device and find out its working mechanisms."

But I had to learn that our men overlooked a crucial thing on that day - Ludwig somehow managed to blow the flute with his last breath, and he was reborn as Mal Amadeus. By the time I got to know that he's still alive and seeks for the flute it was too late - he located me, and... you know the story from here."
