			story=_ "With their new earnings in their pockets, Creona's team headed north to leave Wesnoth. This was usual after noisier jobs, and flooding a whole city was something could be called 'noisy'. Find a village, pay a lot for the accomodation, so the villagers won't tell anybody that you were there, rest a bit, then leave to find a new employer - that was the good old scenario. Nothing implied that it'd be any different this time."
